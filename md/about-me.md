A versatile developer with a passion for the command line, automation, and backend systems.

I thrive on building robust solutions, from Python backends and Bash scripts to customizing Linux environments to perfection. My core motivation comes from tackling problems that require me to learn new technologies and think in different ways. I enjoy the entire development process, from architecting a system to building its core functionality.

My primary areas of expertise include:
- **Languages:** Python, Bash
- **Domains:** Backend Development, Scripting, Networking
- **Operating System:** Linux

Currently, I am channeling my energy into the field of **cybersecurity**, with a specific focus on ethical hacking.
